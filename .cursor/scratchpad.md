# Project Planning and Execution Document

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a metrics collection and reporting system for Open Horizon services and nodes. The system will:
- Run as a containerized Flask application
- Support multiple CPU architectures (armhf, arm64, amd64, s390x, ppc64le, riscv)
- Collect metrics from Open Horizon services and nodes running on the same host
- Provide an API for retrieving accumulated statistics
- Include Grafana integration for visualization
- Follow a specific metrics schema for data consistency

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Multi-architecture Support
   - Need to ensure Docker images work across all specified architectures
   - May require different base images or build configurations for each architecture
   - Need to test on each architecture to ensure compatibility

2. Metrics Collection
   - Need to interface with Open Horizon's local services and nodes
   - Must collect metrics independently from the API request process
   - Need to implement efficient data storage for accumulated metrics

3. API Design
   - Must support retrieval of both latest and historical data points
   - Need to ensure API endpoints match the specified metrics schema
   - Should implement proper error handling and validation
   - Must provide clear documentation for API consumers

4. Grafana Integration
   - Need to create appropriate data source configuration
   - Must design dashboards that effectively visualize the metrics
   - Should ensure proper data refresh and update mechanisms

5. Documentation
   - Need to provide clear API usage examples
   - Must document data schema and response formats
   - Should include troubleshooting guides
   - Need to provide integration examples for common use cases

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- When working with multi-arch Docker builds, ensure all dependencies are compatible with each architecture
- Test metrics collection thoroughly to ensure accurate data gathering
